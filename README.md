## Aim

TODO

## Overview

 - Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge Data
   + Data curation and conversion
   + Creating labels with `ukbb_cardiac` by Bai et al.
   + Evaluating labels by ground truth volume info
   + Training own U-Nets on these labels - hyperparameter search
 - Transfer Learning: 7T human cardiac cine MRI
   + Comparsion of plain learning with transfer learning and double transfer learning
   + Assessing data requirements: training with subsets
   + Exploration of predictions
